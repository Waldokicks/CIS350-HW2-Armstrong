## Technical Background
I have very little experience with coding outside of what I learned in CIS162 and CIS163. I took a coding class in High School which primarily focused on HTML. I know a little bit of C from EGR 106 and 107 when I was a CE major, but I am more comfortable with Java since that's what I have the most experience with.
